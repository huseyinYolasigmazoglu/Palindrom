# Palindrom
Test cases written in VirtueTaskTests.
Code complexity is O(N) .

Algorithm: Firstly remove all non alfanumerice values , than create an histogram for input parameter to count number of character occurance.
Assumtion is simple if character exists even number , we can skip this because we can place these characters to make Palindrom,
only one odd is acceptable we can place this to middle.
